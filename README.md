# The Odin Project - Computer Science Section

## Overview

This README provides an overview of the projects completed in The Odin Project's Computer Science section. These projects cover key computer science concepts and data structures. 

## Recursion

### Fibonacci

- Implemented a `fibs` function using iteration to generate a Fibonacci sequence.
- Developed a recursive solution with the `fibsRec` function for the same problem.
- Gained a solid understanding of recursion and its applications.

### Merge Sort

- Created a `mergeSort` function that sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm.
- Explored the divide-and-conquer strategy used in sorting algorithms.

## Linked Lists

### LinkedList and Node Classes

- Designed a `LinkedList` class and a `Node` class to build a functional linked list.
- Implemented methods like `append`, `prepend`, `pop`, and size-related functions.
- Practiced manipulation of linked lists.

### Binary Search Tree Traversal

#### Node and Tree Classes

- Built a balanced binary search tree (BST) using the `Node` and `Tree` classes.
- Utilized the `buildTree` function to create a BST from an array.
- Visualized tree structures with the `prettyPrint` function.

#### Tree Operations

- Implemented key BST operations: `insert`, `delete`, and `find`.
- Traversed the tree in different orders (inOrder, preOrder, postOrder).
- Calculated node height and depth.
- Checked tree balance using the `isBalanced` function.
- Rebalanced unbalanced trees with the `reBalance` function.

## Knights Travails

### Knight Moves

- Developed a `knightMoves` function to find the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard.
- Represented possible moves as a tree and applied a search algorithm.
- Outputted the path and the number of moves required.
- Introduced me to graph theory.

## Conclusion

These projects provided a good practical opportunity to better understand and apply many computer science concepts, including recursion, sorting algorithms, data structures (linked lists and BSTs), and graph traversal.
